# Nearby Sync Utility

A Flutter plugin for seamless device discovery, connection, and communication (Currently in Development).

## Overview

The **Nearby Sync Utility** aims to simplify peer-to-peer device communication in Flutter applications. This plugin will provide an abstraction layer over **Google Nearby Connections API** (Android) and **Multipeer Connectivity Framework** (iOS) to enable seamless device discovery and communication.

## Planned Features

* Cross-Platform Support
  * Android using Google Nearby Connections API
  * iOS using Multipeer Connectivity Framework

* Core Functionality
  * Automated device discovery in the vicinity
  * Secure peer-to-peer connections
  * Real-time message exchange
  * Event-driven connection status updates

* Developer Experience
  * Simple, intuitive API
  * Comprehensive error handling
  * Battery-efficient operations
  * Extensive documentation and examples

## Proposed Implementation

Here's how the API is planned to work:

```dart
// Initialize the plugin
final nearbySync = NearbySyncUtility();

// Start advertising your device
await nearbySync.startAdvertising();

// Look for other devices
await nearbySync.startDiscovery();

// Handle discovered devices
nearbySync.onDeviceFound.listen((device) {
print("Found device: ${device['deviceName']}");
});

// Connect and send messages
await nearbySync.connectToDevice(deviceId);
await nearbySync.sendMessage(deviceId, "Hello!");
```

## Development Status

The plugin is currently under active development. Key areas of focus:

* Core API design and implementation
* Platform-specific integration
* Testing and optimization
* Documentation preparation

## Getting Started (Coming Soon)

The plugin will be available on pub.dev once the initial development phase is complete. Stay tuned for:

* Installation instructions
* Platform-specific setup guides
* Usage examples
* API documentation
